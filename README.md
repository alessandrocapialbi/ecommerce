Basic e-commerce created with Django Framework and Bootstrap 4.
You can place orders as a guest or as an authenticated user in the admin panel (username: alessandro, password: ecommerce1234).
If you want to run it:
1) Install a virtual environment (pip install virtualenv)
2) Activate it with: source env/bin/active in the terminal
3) Install plugins in requirements.txt (pip install -r requirements.txt)
4) Run the server with: python manage.py runserver

Step 1) and 2) are automatic if you use IDEs like PyCharm and you clone the project.
